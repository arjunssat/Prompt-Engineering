# Prompt Engineering


<ul>
  Guidelines::

The course covers two key principles for writing prompts:
1.	Clear and specific instructions.
2.	Giving model time to think.
It emphasizes the importance of using delimiters, such as using triple backticks or quotes, to indicate distinct parts of the input and avoid prompt injections. Also, for a structured output like JSON and HTML format, is suggested to make parsing model responses easier.” Few-shot prompting” also suggested for successful task executions before requesting the actual task from the model.
The Second principle highlights the need to give the model time to reason and avoid to provide incorrect conclusions. Tactics for this principle include specifying the steps required to complete a task, allowing the model to work out its own solution before reaching a conclusion, and comparing the model’s output to a given solution.
